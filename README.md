# Calligraful

A kanji learning app for mobile devices that uses automated handwriting analysis to test JLPT kanji in an SRS format.

## Ideas

- Test writing kanji given on/kun readings + example words + RTK keyword
  - Not sure if the RTK dataset is free or available to use given an open license
- ipadOS only to make use of the Apple pen
- Grade writings via some sort of AI-based OCR similiar to how Shirabe Jisho can tell what kanji is being drawn on screen
- Use the FSRS algorithm for SRS portion of the app
